# Barrio

Barrio is designed to facillitate a decentralised local second-hand commerce market reducing waste and encouraging sustainability, by allowing people to buy and sell local items with ETH. Sellers can list an item for sale in their local area, and buyers can put in an offer.
They then meet up in person to complete the exchange, and as the goods change hands, the seller ensures that the buyer confirms the purchase in the app and that the funds have arrived. Alternatively, both the buyer and seller can agree on a trusted third party to complete the sale, allowing, for example, auction houses, estate agents, shops and other third parties to negotiate purchases.
Barrio provides a mechanism to allow for the purchase and sale of real-world off-chain assets, whilst building up a system of reputation and trust to facilitate future trade.
The project brings off chain assets and the history of their sales on-chain - adding a metadata and provenance layer with IPFS and Ethereum.
Listing data, should as item photos and descriptions can be optionally stored in IPFS, adding further provenance confidence for future resales. This is useful for the verification and resale of items such a bikes, antiques, jewelery and other second hand goods, by building a reputation based system.
The project hopes that by blending the second hand market with the crypto space, that we can incentivise the reduction of waste and instead promote reuse, re/upcycling and local purchases, by integrating a token based incentive ecosystem.

To do:

-   Implement review system, so that buyers and sellers can build up reputation, eventually enabling a new sales model, where buyers could have confidence to hand over funds before receiveing the product.
-   Add a secure and encrypted messaging system to allow buyers/sellers to negotiate on price, meetup location and potentially trusted third parties.
-   Add token functionality to receive tokens upon sale/purchase of a listed item.
-   Add small fee to list item, to cover future filecoin storage costs, and to deter people from mining tokens by selling and buying their own items.
-   Tokens can then be used to vote on dApp upgrades, to facillitate a community-led project.
-   FE that allows you to search by location, price, seller reviews etc.
-   Take a small cut of listing price when a purchase happens
